To define Path constructively,
we may get some inspiration from its topological definition.
Open-up the \href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/path}{``path'' segment in nLab},
there is a mathematical definition of a path, written as:

\[
  \mathbb I \rightarrow X
  \xtag
\]

Topologically, a path in a space $X$ is a continuous map
from an interval (denoted $\mathbb I$) to $X$.
Type theoretically, $\mathbb I$ and $X$ are types,
and $\mathbb I \rightarrow X$ is a function type from $\mathbb I$ to $X$.
As paths represent a relation \textit{between} two terms
(endpoints, but type theoretically),
these two terms should show up in the path type as well
(similar to MLTT identity type).
Therefore the formation rule for path types is naturally:

\[
  \cfrac{
    \Gamma \vdash X \ \textbf{type}
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash a : X
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash b : X
  }{\Gamma \vdash a =_X b \ \textbf{type}}
  \xtag
\]

Up to the time where this note is written,
everyone tries to define constructive HoTT defines path types this way.
They have different introduction and elimination rules,
but all of their introduction rules are
based on the interval type $\mathbb I$
and the elimination rules are slimiar to function application.

We can also define heterogeneous path types
(path between two terms of different types)
by changing the type $X$ into a type family $f$,
indexed by the interval type $\mathbb I$,
to allow paths between terms of different types:

\[
  \cfrac{
    \Gamma \vdash X \ \textbf{type}
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash a : X
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash b : X
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash f : \mathbb I \rightarrow X
  }{\Gamma \vdash a =_f b \ \textbf{type}}
  \xtag \label{eqn:hetero-path}
\]

Heterogeneous paths are used in~\cref{subsec:path-hit}.

\subsection{Transport}
\label{subsec:coe}

The idea of \textit{type-safe coercion} is like
casting a variable of type $A$ to type $B$ by providing a proof
of $A =_{\mathcal U} B$:

\[
  \textsf{coe} : A =_{\mathcal U} B \rightarrow A \rightarrow B
  \xtag \label{eqn:coe-a-b-id}
\]

Bringing in the idea of path types,
assuming $p : A =_{\mathcal U} B$, by~\ref{eqn:path-app}
we know that $p \ \textsf 0 \equiv A$ and
$p \ \textsf 1 \equiv B$,
so~\ref{eqn:coe-a-b-path} is effectively the same
as~\ref{eqn:coe-a-b-id}:

\[
  \textsf{coe} : (p : A =_{\mathcal U} B) \rightarrow p \ \textsf 0
  \rightarrow p \ \textsf 1
  \xtag \label{eqn:coe-a-b-path}
\]

The return type of \textsf{coe} can be generalized over
the interval on the input path:

\[
  \textsf{coe} : (p : A =_{\mathcal U} B) \rightarrow p \ \textsf 0
  \rightarrow (i : \mathbb I) \rightarrow p \ i
  \xtag \label{eqn:coe-a-b-path-gen}
\]

\ref{eqn:coe-a-b-path-gen} is known as the ``generalized transport''
operation, denoted as \textsf{coe} in Arend and CCTT,
and \AgdaFunction{transp} in CTT.
We use \textsf{coe} to refer to this general concept for consistency.
And by the way,
Arend's \textsf{coe} takes function over interval instead
of a path as its first argument:

\[
  \textsf{coe} : (p : I \rightarrow \mathcal U)
  \rightarrow p \ \textsf 0
  \rightarrow (i : \mathbb I) \rightarrow p \ i
  \xtag
\]

Right now there is neither nontrivial path nor path on types,
while transport along identity paths is just a fancy version
of the identity function, thus we do not need to worry about the
computation of \textsf{coe} yet.
We further discuss \textsf{coe} in~\cref{sec:ua}.

In CTT and CCTT, we cannot transport along paths between paths,
but it's not the case in Arend.
Arend uses \textsf{coe} to prove path symmetry and transitivity.
Here's a proof, assuming three inhabitants $a, b, c$ of type $A$
and the trivial path $\refl_a : a =_A a$:

\[
  \cfrac{
    \Gamma \vdash p : a =_A b
  }{
    \Gamma \vdash (\textsf{coe}
    (\lambda i. (p\ i =_A a)) \ \refl_a \ \textsf 1)
    : b =_A a
  }
  \xtag \label{eqn:arend-proof-sym}
\]

% Note that in Arend's concrete syntax, path application is not
% $p\ i$ but $p\ @\ i$ and lambda abstraction is not $\lambda x.y$ but
% $\backslash{}\textsf{lam} \ x \Rightarrow y$.
The Arend's concrete syntax of~\ref{eqn:arend-proof-sym} is:

\begin{minted}{arend-lexer.py:ArendLexer -x}
  \func sym {A : \Type} {a b : A} (p : a = b) : b = a =>
    coe (\lam i => p @ i = a) idp right
\end{minted}

What happened in~\ref{eqn:arend-proof-sym} is that we transported
along the following interval lambda:

\[
  f = \lambda i. (p\ i =_A a)
  \xtag
\]

As $p : a =_A b$, we have
$(f \ \textsf 0) \equiv (p \ \textsf 0 =_A a) \equiv (a =_A a)$ and
$(f \ \textsf 1) \equiv (p \ \textsf 1 =_A a) \equiv (b =_A a)$,
so $f$ is similar to a path $(a =_A a) =_{\mathcal U} (b =_A a)$.
By providing a proof \refl of $a =_A a$,
we obtain the proof of the right hand side of $f$, which is $b =_A a$.
The proof of transitivity is similar, as in~\ref{eqn:arend-proof-trans}.
Analyzing how it works is left as an exercise.

\[
  \cfrac{
    \Gamma \vdash p : a =_A b
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash q : b =_A c
  }{
    \Gamma \vdash (\textsf{coe}
    (\lambda i. (a =_A q\ i)) \ p \ \textsf 1)
    : a =_A c
  }
  \xtag \label{eqn:arend-proof-trans}
\]

It looks like the following in Arend:

\begin{minted}{arend-lexer.py:ArendLexer -x}
  \func trans {A : \Type} {a b c : A}
              (p : a = b) (q : b = c) : a = c =>
    coe (\lam i => a = q @ i) p right
\end{minted}
