\section{Path types}
\label{sec:path}

To define Path constructively,
we may get some inspiration from its topological definition.
Open-up the \href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/path}{``path'' segment in nLab},
there is a mathematical definition of a path, written as:

\[
  \mathbb I \rightarrow X
  \xtag
\]

Topologically, a path in a space $X$ is a continuous map
from an interval (denoted $\mathbb I$) to $X$.
Type theoretically, $\mathbb I$ and $X$ are types,
and $\mathbb I \rightarrow X$ is a function type from $\mathbb I$ to $X$.
As paths represent a relation \textit{between} two terms
(endpoints, but type theoretically),
these two terms should show up in the path type as well
(similar to MLTT identity type).
Therefore the formation rule for path types is naturally:

\[
  \cfrac{
    \Gamma \vdash X \ \textbf{type}
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash a : X
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash b : X
  }{\Gamma \vdash a =_X b \ \textbf{type}}
  \xtag
\]

Up to the time where this note is written,
everyone tries to define constructive HoTT defines path types this way.
They have different introduction and elimination rules,
but all of their introduction rules are
based on the interval type $\mathbb I$
and the elimination rules are slimiar to function application.

We can also define heterogeneous path types
(path between two terms of different types)
by changing the type $X$ into a type family $f$,
indexed by the interval type $\mathbb I$,
to allow paths between terms of different types:

\[
  \cfrac{
    \Gamma \vdash X \ \textbf{type}
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash a : X
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash b : X
    \quad
    \Gamma \vdash f : \mathbb I \rightarrow X
  }{\Gamma \vdash a =_f b \ \textbf{type}}
  \xtag \label{eqn:hetero-path}
\]

Heterogeneous paths are used in~\cref{subsec:path-hit}.
